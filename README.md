# eXam
During my 12th class, I had the opportunity to develop this application named eXam as part of my Informatics course. This application, built in Java and MySQL, was specifically designed to facilitate the smooth administration of MCQ-based tests within a local network.

A major highlight of this project is its successful deployment in Sri Sathya Sai Higher Secondary School, where it is currently in active use. Witnessing the application's practical implementation in a real educational environment has been immensely rewarding.
